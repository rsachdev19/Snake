# Snake
About this project: This is a project by me(Ravjot Sachdev). This is a recreation of the classic game Snake.
I made this project in highschool after I first started to learn how to program to practice certain Java principles.
The large majority of the code was written during the summer of 2015, with the first edits being made in the Fall of 2017.

About the game:
The objective of the game is 

About the code:
The game is mading using javax.swing and java.awt. I may try to recreate the game in JavaFX in the future.
The  code is entirely contained within one Java file, Snake.java, as I had not yet learned about Objects when I first started the project.

ToDo List:
-Add background music
-Add a new thread(s) for sound clips
-Add a game over sound clip
-Add a main menu screen/game over screen
-Main menu screen should contain: start, about this game (objective), controls, credits
